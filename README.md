# YouTube Channel Data Harvesting And Warehousing
The YouTube Channel Data Harvesting And Warehousing aims to provide users with the capability to retrieve and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. Through this project, users can gain insights into channel performance, audience demographics, and content trends, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies for content creation, marketing, and audience engagement.

## Overview

Python scripts are utilized for harvesting data from YouTube, a Streamlit web application for visualization, API integration for data collection, and data management using SQL. This project aims to collect, store, and visualize YouTube data for analytical purposes.

## Tools Used

- **Python**:
  Python is widely utilized in YouTube data harvesting and warehousing due to its versatility, extensive libraries, and ease of use. Developers leverage Python's robust libraries such as Requests and Pandas, enabling them to extract data from YouTube channels, videos, and user interactions effectively.

- **Google API Client**:
  In this project, the googleapiclient library in Python plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between the application code and YouTube's Data API v3. By leveraging this library, developers can effortlessly integrate functionalities to retrieve essential data such as channel metadata, video specifics, and user comments from YouTube's vast database. The googleapiclient library simplifies the process of interacting with YouTube's API, offering developers a straightforward and efficient means to access and manipulate the platform's extensive data resources programmatically.

- **MySQL**:
  MySQL facilitates the storage and retrieval of various types of data relevant to YouTube, including user interactions, video metadata, comments, and analytics. It provides a structured and organized approach to managing datasets, enabling efficient querying and analysis of the harvested data.

- **Streamlit**:
  Streamlit simplifies YouTube data projects by facilitating the creation of interactive web apps for analyzing channel data. It provides quick insights into user behavior and content performance, aiding informed decision-making.
